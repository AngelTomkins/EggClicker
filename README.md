# Egg Clicker
Egg Clicker as a simple clicker game written in Rust with the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.

The game is planned to be compiler and hosted online on itch.io and/or on my own website for users to enjoy. The code will always be accessible to users through github and planned releases will be compiled for all major platforms. Mobile support for Android/IOS is planned.
